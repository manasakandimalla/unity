Basic 2 player game (-Augmented reality version)

-> Project still under development.
-> In AR Camera mode a ground with 2 players and a ball shows up.
-> The player with blue marking on top is to hit into the blue goal and similarly in case of red marked player.
-> The controls of the player are as of now directly from the keyboard.
-> For player1 :
	Up arrow key     :  run forward   (keep pressing the key)
	Down arrow key   :  run backwards (keep pressing the key)
	Right arrow key  :  turn right    (press key once to turn)
	Left arrow key   :  turn left     (press key once to turn)
-> For player2 :
	"W"              :  run forward   (keep pressing the key)
	"S"              :  run backwards (keep pressing the key)
	"D"              :  turn right    (press key once to turn)
	"A"              :  turn left     (press key once to turn)
-> After a goal the ball automatically comes to the initial position.
-> There is a time limit of 3 minutes for the game based on which A win or Draw is declared.

-> The player movement is currently a bit disturbed due to a few constraints(yet to be improved).
